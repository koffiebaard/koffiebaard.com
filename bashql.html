	<p>
		BashQL (Bash Query Language) is a database management system (dbms) and database engine rolled into one.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's completely written in Bash, and has three dependencies; grep, awk &amp; jq.
	</p>
	<p>
		Very quick setup and transparent: databases are set up locally in the BashQL install directory. Easy to back up and ship elsewhere.
