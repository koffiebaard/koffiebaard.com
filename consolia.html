	<h1>Consolia</h1>
	<p>Consolia is my webcomic, it's mostly about programming. I would classify Consolia as technical and weird, with a hint of dumb jokes. </p>
	<p>But I also have a passion for simplifying technology to a point anyone can understand. I occasionally write <a href="https://consolia-comic.com/tag/explanation">explanation comics</a> where i aim to do exactly this. I'm also working on a book that takes this to the next level. So if you know any publishers, let me know!</p>
