	<h1>My name is 404</h1>
	<p>My first book! It's a fully illustrated children's book, about a robot named <b>404</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		404 is a robot that lives
		inside the internet. The little robot gets lost
		quite often.
	</p>

	<p>
		Regardless 404 still travels
		the internet, meeting a lot
		of new friends while doing so.

		Friends like a weird robot
		called <b>500</b> and a teapot
		called <b>418</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Together they will surely
		find their destination.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Sidenote:</b> I wrote it in two languages; english and dutch.
